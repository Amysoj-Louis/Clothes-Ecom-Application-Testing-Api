# Clothes Ecom Application Testing Api #

Hi, this is a flask Api which outputs json dataset of data scraped from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/). It has image url and price. It can be used in applications which doesn't use brand names for sales and only price and image matters. 

Note: 
- I don't have the copyright of the images thus please don't use in production code.
- I haven't added the CORS support for websites. If you wish to add CORS refer to this docs of [flask_cors](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- The category names are Case sensitive

Hope you have a good day, Happy Coding :)
